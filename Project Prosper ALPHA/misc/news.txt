Update 3 Patch Notes:

Main changes:
- Added Enemies
- Added Player health and hunger
- Added first boss
- Changed player model and added sprites for holding items

Improvements:
-Changed how sprites are stored resulting in a staggering 90% memory reduction
-The above change also allows for worlds to be saved. (currently only after generation, press space on main menu to load it)
-PyEngine improvements (mainly to `Projectile` class)

Known Problems:
-Infinite Cactus (it was fixed and then it unfixed itself)
-Invisible Enemies? (needs more testing but i don't think they're visible anymore)
-Crafting and smelting at the same time is goofy (will be fixed when unique inventories are added)
Other things i can't remember

Future things:
-Unique inventories(chests and stuff)
-Loot tables
-Ranged weapons (and ammo)
